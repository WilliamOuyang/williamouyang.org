          <strong>Abstract.</strong> A system designed to optimize efficiency in
          the individual, increase achievement, and eliminate hindrances. It's
          primary purpose is to alleviate mental exhaustion, decision fatigue,
          and excessive memory usage. The system is created through two parts –
          one: documentation for planning design, two: a website for content
          storage and display. The website is derived from its blueprint, white
          paper, which outlines details of construction, components, and
          rationale. All information on the website, with the exception of the
          white paper, will be altered by algorithms befitting its purpose. It
          will employ a cross-platform structure to minimize applications and a
          central interface that manages fragmented programs. This design will
          create a compact site with an UI that directs viewers to tasks for the
          sake of ease.

          Humans are inherently power-driven creatures. For the three-hundred
          thousand years of modern human existence, it has been man's greatest
          ambition to seize power, driven purely for the sake of satisfying
          self-interests. Although power can be acquired under the justification
          as a means to establish peace or for the cause of preserving the
          species as a whole, these intentions remain definitive outliers in
          history. By its design, power far better suits the individual. It's
          benefits multiply when applied to the individual and comparatively
          dilute when collectively shared. This makes retaining power too
          tempting an offer and sharing seem insensible. Power is the ability to
          enforce your will upon the world; power satiates fundamental human
          desires, it grants control, protection, status, a sense of
          achievement, freedom, and comfort. Ironically, power is depicted as a
          morally corrupting force and a contemptible motive. In contradiction,
          “greatness” is classed as far more socially acceptable and even noble
          in certain cases. In reality, the truth couldn't be further than that
          depiction. Greatness and power are inextricably intertwined, yet power
          is condemned and greatness is commended. In conventional terms,
          greatness is defined as the acquisition of great wealth, expression of
          eminence, and the attainment of extraordinary capabilities. However, a
          more appropriate definition of greatness is power. Between the two,
          there is no difference, greatness is power, and power is greatness.
          The only altering factor in the relationship between the two is the
          exchange rate – variety in either or both quantity and form. <br />
          &nbsq; An important distinction to note is the difference between the
          four categories of historical greats. First, there were those that
          were adored, celebrated, and revered in their time, and in the next.
          Second, there were people who were favoured in their time, but later
          scrutinized, criticized, and mocked by modern standards. Third, people
          who are universally despised; and fourth, those who were those who
          were considered great oppressors and villains in their times, and even
          for ages, but later begrudgingly won respect from future generations
          for their accomplishments and capabilities. The great difference in
          these categories of individuals is in their methodology, they
          carefully balance manipulation, planning, persona, and execution. The
          powerful figures of history will always be regarded with either
          adoration or disdain from the masses. Their influence is indisputable,
          and their imprint upon history solidifies them as visionaries.

          The idea behind the system originated from my personal need of a
          method to organize and control my own thought process. I aim to manage
          my own preference for hyper-focus on details. In the past, I have
          created a substantial quantity of renditions of a plan (which
          consisted of scheduled routines, rule requirements, outlines, and
          applications) to be implemented. All of which befell the same
          shortcoming. The complication of length and excessive engineering.
          Although these plans, from a technical perspective, fulfil the
          criteria and intended purpose, they are lacking practical value. After
          the initial formation of a plan, they would gradually divulge into a
          mess and a major nuisance, a short duration after the initial
          development, due to its extreme depth, dependent chain linking on
          components (which leads to the requirement of total revision changes,
          even for minor altercations) – with rigid schedule structure enforcing
          events in a fixed time sequence, which causes disruption through the
          whole network from one failed event, nested content of categories, and
          increasingly complicated structure in both or either reference and
          construction. Ultimately, these failures caused irreparable disruption
          that compelled me to restart. I was frustrated from the inability of
          all previous models to achieve satisfactory results. As such, I have
          decided to avoid previous process routine heavy design and instead
          make two components. First, a white paper drafting the concept and
          ideals of the project, then create the second platform by applying
          general knowledge, not specified structure, from the white paper's
          content. Now that the need for the structure is outlined, I will delve
          into a brief about the baser cause of everything. <br />
          &nbsq; Since birth, I have always been possessed entirely by an
          obsession with an objective. There is an ever-present fixation, in the
          form of a goal, which holds the utmost importance in my existence and
          from which I derive the justification of my being. I understand the
          reality of my nature and the subsistence of the mind. The lofty
          ambition which I pursue is the most fundamental goal in human
          existence ever devised – power. It is based on this aspiration that
          the idea for the framework was devised. The result would be a
          foolproof system of intricate structure and flawless design to ensure
          the achievement of the objective and the perpetuity of consistent
          thought.

          The system is created through two parts. First, an outline that
          details the design of the system. Within this, the instructions to
          create the second structure is elaborated. Second, a website to house
          the content of the white paper.

          <br /> Time Management Format: A guideline for planning daily
          activities. It provides the outline for events and what time frame
          they are to be completed in. This ensures that routine commitments are
          completed in the proper course of events. Scheduling Format: A idly
          calendar format for scheduling tasks and events. It helps organize
          time commitments ensuring that the content on the time management
          format is followed faithfully. Exercise: A regimen of callisthenics
          and stretching, which is essential to maintain physical health and
          high performance capacity. Tenet: My objective written. It's purpose
          is to be continually referenced and repetitively read to boost focus
          on what I aspire to achieve. Chores: A list of routine tasks that must
          be completed regularly to maintain household living standards.
          Cleaning: A task list of upholding cleanliness in living and working
          environments. Personal Vault: A record of personal financial assets.
          Dashboard: A method of reviewing and managing personal financial
          investments.
